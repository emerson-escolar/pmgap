# pmgap
Computations for Persistence Modules using GAP

This package is still in alpha development. 
Features are incomplete, and the API is subject to changes as deemed necessary.
pmgap relies heavily on [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/qpa.html) for basic objects and computations involving quiver representations.
That is, pmgap specializes the general quiver representations in [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/qpa.html) 
to commutative grid representations (2D persistence modules) and adds several new functions that are of interest for such representations.

# What can it do?

Currently, the following main features are implemented.

1. Objects representing persistence modules over finite commutative grids and functions to work with them. 
   * Creation of commutative grids and persistence modules
   * Reading and writing files that represent persistence modules
   * Enumeration of interval persistence modules
   
2. Computation of the interval-decomposable part of a persistence module, using the algorithm in **H. Asashiba, M. Buchet, E. G. Escolar, K. Nakashima, and M. Yoshiwaki. "On Interval Decomposability of 2D Persistence Modules". [arXiv:1812.05261](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05261)**. 
   These computations can be performed within GAP, or using the convenience scripts:
   ```
   pmgap_interval_decomposable.sh
   ```
   and
   ```
   pmgap_batch_interval_decomposable.sh
   ```
   provided (installation of utility scripts needed).

3. Computation of the compressed multiplicity and interval-decomposable approximation over 2 x n grids, as introduced in **H. Asashiba, E. G. Escolar, K. Nakashima, and M. Yoshiwaki. "On Approximation of 2D Persistence Modules by Interval-decomposables". [arXiv:1911.01637](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01637)**
   These computations can be performed within GAP, or using the convenience script:
   ```
   pmgap_interval_approximation.sh
   ``` 
   provided (installation of utility scripts needed).
   
4. Creation of persistence module over finite finite commutative grid from a bifiltered simplicial complex, using the program
   ```
   pmgap_cmplx2repn
   ```
   (compilation and installation of utility scripts needed).
   
# Demos 
1. Demo for the paper **[On Approximation of 2D Persistence Modules by Interval-decomposables](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01637)** (compressed multiplicity and interval-decomposable approximation):

    After completing **Install Part 1: GAP package pmgap** below, navigate to the demos folder inside a terminal and run
    ```
    gap pmgap_demo_interval_approximation.g
    ```
    to run the demo.


# Install

## Part 1: GAP package pmgap

1. Install [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) and its packages, which already includes [QPA](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/qpa.html).

2. Locate and choose a pkg directory where GAP searches for packages. See 
   Section 9.2 "GAP Root Directories" of the GAP manual for more information.
   
   It can be any pkg/ subdirectory of one of the directories returned by running:
   ```
   gap> GAPInfo.RootPaths;
   ```
   in gap. A typical choice is to use the directory `~/.gap/pkg/`.
   
3. Clone/download this repository as a subfolder in the pkg directory. 
   As an example, all the contents of this repository will be inside `~/.gap/pkg/pmgap-master`.
   Alternatively, a symbolic link can also be used.

4. Run tests by running
   ```
   >> gap tst/testall.g
   ```
   in the pmgap folder, inside the shell (outside of GAP).
   
5. Compile the documentation by running
   ```
   >> gap makedoc.g
   ```
   in the pmgap folder, inside the shell (outside of GAP).
   
6. Load the package with
   ```
   gap> LoadPackage("pmgap");
   ```
   inside of GAP. If installed correctly, this should work from any folder.

## Part 2: utility scripts

0. Ensure that the following libraries are installed.

    - [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
    - [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
    - [TCLAP](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/)
    - [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
    - autoconf
    - automake
    - libtool
    
    The above requirements may be available using your operating system's package manager. For example, using apt on Ubuntu, the requirements may be satisifed by installing
    
    - libeigen3-dev
    - nlohmann-json3-dev
    - libtclap-dev
    - catch
    - autoconf
    - automake
    - libtool
    
    respectively. 
    
    This project used to depend on [gyoza](https://bitbucket.org/remere/gyoza/src/master/), but this dependency has been removed. This project now directly contains code from gyoza.


1. Navigate to this project's folder (as set in step 3 above).

2. Run the following commands, making sure that the previous command succeeds before proceeding to the next one.
   ```
   autoreconf --install
   ```
   ```
   ./configure
   ```
   ```
   make
   ```
   ```
   make check
   ```
   ```
   make install
   ```


## TROUBLESHOOTING

1. `./configure` complains that "Eigen header not found".
    [SOLUTION] Try adding Eigen to CPPFLAGS as follows: 
    ```
    ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/eigen3
    ```
    or wherever you have installed Eigen.

2. Shared library not found when running c++ utilities.
   [SOLUTION] Try running
   ```
   sudo ldconfig
   ```
   See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/480764/linux-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-s
   
3. `make install` gives "Permission denied" error.
   [SOLUTION] Install as 
   ```
   sudo make install
   ```
   or use `--prefix` option with `./configure` in order to change the installation directory.
   See
   ```
   ./configure --help
   ```
   for more details.
